This repository houses the code and data used for the security price prediciton project.

The helpers file contains the functions used to preprocess the data

The experiment_runs file contains the experiments ran. Note, these functions were continusally altered and used for testing all 3 models (by switching out the models called).
The functions were reverted back to a base state, all using the BPNN networks, save the CNN specific functions. If there are any innacuracies it is likely due to a lingering
remnant from past exerpiment iterations.

The ModelFunctions file contains the functions used create, train, and to pass parameters to the models

The Data file contains a link to a OneDrive folder that houses the consolidated data. It is broked up into 5 csv files.
